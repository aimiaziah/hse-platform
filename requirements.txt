# Python dependencies for YOLO AI Model Server
# Optimized for DigitalOcean deployment with minimal disk usage

# FastAPI server dependencies
fastapi==0.115.0
uvicorn[standard]==0.32.0
python-multipart==0.0.18
pydantic==2.10.0

# Image processing
pillow==11.0.0

# ONNX runtime for YOLO inference (lightweight, CPU-only)
# This is MUCH smaller than PyTorch and doesn't include CUDA/cuDNN
onnxruntime==1.20.0

# YOLO library - must be installed AFTER onnxruntime to avoid pulling PyTorch
ultralytics>=8.3.0

# Note: We use ONNX format (.onnx) models instead of PyTorch (.pt) to avoid
# installing torch and torchvision which are very large (~2GB) and include
# CUDA/cuDNN dependencies that cause DigitalOcean build failures
